    "Montreal is a city at the heart of French Canada. Anyone who visits this city is sure to find European cultural symbolism around every street corner. The idea that the city is located in the North American continent might elude some folks. The vibrancy & aesthetics of the city, coupled with the liveliness of the party scene attracts lots of tourism from beyond the south border every year.\n",
    "\n",
    "Political discourse and \"immigration-friendly\" policy has shaped much of the remainder of Canada and Canadian Real-estate. While Montreal is lagging behind the curve on real estate trends seen elsewhere in the country, it has not managed to escape similar patterns. With a huge influx of International students into Canadian city-centers, real estate demand in those areas is on the uptrend. Add to that, foreign afluent businessmen are known to invest heavily into these same places pushing local home-buyers to explore further into the suburbs. \n",
    "\n",
    "Montreal's real estate market has managed to stay relatively cheaper than other major cities but that is sure to change in the following years as more and more investors realize the potential. For homebuyers, it is key that they find relatively undervalued properties that have good growth potential for when the upsurge does hit. A good indicator of a properties value are the venues that surround it. If we can use that as a predictor, Montreal homebuyers would be able to find undervalued properties and aid them in their decision-making."
